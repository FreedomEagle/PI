###PI is derived through two methods and analyzed.


1. **Pi-BBP** consists of
⋅⋅* Pi-bbp.c which has the Baily-Borwein-Plouffe  method of calculating PI
..* Pi-fun.h 
..* Main1.c which has the function to determine how fast Leibniz method converges
2. **Pi-Leibniz** consists of
⋅⋅* Pi-Leibniz.c which has the Leibniz method of calculating PI
..* Pi-fun2.h 
..* Main2.c which has the function to determine how fast Leibniz method converges
3. **Main3.c** which compares the efficency between Pi-BBP& Pi-Leibniz
